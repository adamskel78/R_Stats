## MPG Regression
    Multiple line regression was used to create a linear module that would help show some variables that could help predict the MPG dataset. After analysis it was found that vehicle length and ground clearance were the best predictors of MPG since both of their P values were under .05. Vehicle weight was only .07 which is above our threshold but might have been looked at more closely with the other two factors. The slope of the linear model is not considered zero since the p-value of the F-statistic is again under our .05 threshold as well. The linear model has a 71% chance of predicting the Mpg of the prototypes correctly. That is a better than average predictor. 

## Suspension Coil Summary
    The mean, median, variance, and standard deviation for the PSI of the suspension coils that came from three different lots were summarized in the R Script. The findings for Lot 1 were that there were very little difference between the sample tested. The standard deviation for the group was less than 1. Lot 2 was not as good as lot one but the variance was only 7.5 and the standard deviation was 2.7. With Lot 3 we ran into a problem. The variance exceeded 100 lbs with a variance of 170 lbs. The current design specification at Lot 3 would need to be addressed because they are above the variance of 100 lbs that was set.

## Suspension Coil T-Test
    A one sample t-test was used to determine if the mean of the samples from the three lots were statistically different from the mean population which is 1500. Lot 1 and Lot 2 showed no statistical difference from the population mean because the p-value for both were above the .05 threshold. Lot 3 had a p-value of .04 which would show that it is statically different from the population mean of 1500 since it below the threshold of .05 .

## Design Your Own Study
    People buy cars for different reasons but there are some principles that people use to select a car. Tests should be performed on cars in the same class such as a sedan, pick up, town car, small suv, or large suv for example. We should look at cars in the MechaCar's class. Next, the factors that should be looked at are initial price and residual price. It is important to find out which cars hold their value over time. Another factor that should be investigated should be is fuel efficiency. People care more about cars that will use less gasoline over time. The final factor should be color options. It would be interesting to know if cars with more color options, have higher sales numbers as well. After that we could find which colors sold at a higher rate. 
   The first test should be a a box and whiskers plot and a anova test with the car buying factors as the x axis and the total sales as the y axis. This would show us which factors mean would be different from the others. We would could perform some correlation tests on the means that showed a statistical difference form the other means in the category. The null hypothesis is that there is no statistical difference in that amount of cars sold that have different initial costs, residual costs, color choice, and fuel efficiency. The alternative hypothesis is that one of those factors does cause a statistical difference in regards to sells.  We could use the factor or factors that have a statistically significant difference from the other means, to perform more tests. We could see if there is a positive correlation between those factors in car sales with a liner regression test and the test for correlation.
